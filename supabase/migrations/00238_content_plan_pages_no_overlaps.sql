-- 00238: content_plan_pages without the overlaps (Content Editor, CE-014)
-- ============================================================================
-- Since #1320 the Plan shows the brand's cited pages as an Overview, and
-- nothing reads content_plan_pages' `overlaps` any more (contentPlan.ts no
-- longer maps it). Its four steps (cur_answers, page_prompts, competing,
-- page_overlaps) were the only part of the read that walked prompt_results
-- and prompt_result_citations row by row: with a cold cache the 30-day call
-- took 8.7–9.5 s on the largest brand, over the 8 s statement timeout,
-- against 0.7 s (30 days) and 1.1 s (90 days) without them.
--
-- The function is otherwise 00226's, with the same signature, so its grants
-- and comment carry over (create or replace). 00237 is left for the Mentions
-- Perception read (#1325).
